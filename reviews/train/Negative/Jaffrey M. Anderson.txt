One of the most popular films of 2005 feels like a retread of the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films without a stitch of personality. (Director Andrew Adamson previously graced us with the lowbrow Shrek movies.) We get the expected beautiful British children (with full, Hollywood lips), lots of CGI creatures, some "exciting" battle sequences accompanied by trumpeting music, and a few "wonder" sequences in which things are discovered for the first time. Only Tilda Swinton, cast as the White Witch, provides a burst of energy; she surveys everything around her as if profoundly disgusted by everyone else's sheer incompetence. It probably helps if you're a fan of the C.S. Lewis books, but I'm not. It's very long, and sequels will be coming.
